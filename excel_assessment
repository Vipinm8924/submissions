Excel assessments are a great way to showcase skills in data management and analysis. What specific tasks or challenges are you facing with the Conditional Formatting, Excel Formulae, and Data Manipulation in your assessment? I can certainly help guide you through some of the key concepts or provide assistance with any specific problems you might have encountered.
import openpyxl
import pandas as pd

# Load the Excel file
file_path = 'your_excel_file.xlsx'
wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(file_path)

# Access a specific sheet
sheet = wb['Sheet1']

# Conditional Formatting Example
# Assume you want to apply a rule to highlight cells greater than 50 in column A
for row in sheet.iter_rows(min_row=2, max_row=sheet.max_row, min_col=1, max_col=1):
    for cell in row:
        if cell.value and cell.value > 50:
            cell.fill = openpyxl.styles.PatternFill(start_color="FF0000", end_color="FF0000", fill_type="solid")

# Excel Formulae Example
# Adding a new column C with a formula that multiplies values in columns A and B
for row in range(2, sheet.max_row + 1):
    sheet[f'C{row}'] = f'=A{row}*B{row}'

# Data Manipulation Example using pandas
# Read Excel file into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name='Sheet1')

# Manipulate data using pandas (e.g., filtering, calculations)
filtered_data = df[df['ColumnA'] > 50]  # Filtering data where ColumnA > 50
sum_column_b = df['ColumnB'].sum()  # Calculating the sum of ColumnB

# Write manipulated data back to Excel
with pd.ExcelWriter(file_path, engine='openpyxl') as writer:
    writer.book = wb
    filtered_data.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='FilteredData', index=False)
    writer.save()
